## Session Log

### Session 4 - February 3, 2026
**Worked on:** Recipe cleanup (buffbaby vault), Magic Machines architecture, documentation reorganization

**Recipe Cleanup (buffbaby vault):**
- Added missing `# titles` to 2 files (gf pancakes, Tuna Rools)
- Converted `**bold**` section headers to `##` headers (4 files)
- Deleted emoji section markers (👉🏻)
- Converted 74 files from bullets/numbered lists to checkboxes (`- [ ]`)
- Fixed YAML frontmatter that was accidentally converted
- Standardized recipe formatting across ~80 recipe files

**Magic Machines Architecture:**
- Introduced "Magic Machines" concept - AI-powered content transformation tools
- Designed as "write" counterpart to Visualizers ("read" tools)
- Created modular manifest format (JSON with prompts, settings, I/O)
- Designed flat YAML frontmatter for status tracking (`mm_<machine-name>: date`)
- Flat structure chosen for Obsidian Properties compatibility

**Recipe Scaling System Plan:**
- Researched Cooklang markup language for recipes
- Designed Cooklang-inspired syntax: `@ingredient{qty%unit}`
- Planned hybrid visualizer (build-time parser + runtime scaler)
- Documented scaling UI and servings metadata approach

**Documentation Reorganization:**
- Created `docs/implementation-plans/` folder
- Moved all implementation plans and roadmaps to new location
- Established naming conventions:
  - `bloob-haus-*.md` for roadmaps/phase plans
  - `YYYY-MM-DD_*.md` for feature-specific plans
- Updated CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md with new conventions
- Created `2026-02-03_recipe-scaling-and-magic-machines.md`

### Session 3 - February 2, 2026
**Worked on:** Interactive checkboxes, visualizer architecture, documentation

**Checkbox Tracker Visualizer:**
- Created modular visualizer folder structure (`hugo/assets/js/visualizers/`, `css/visualizers/`)
- Implemented checkbox-tracker.js with localStorage persistence
- Floating reset button appears only when boxes are checked
- 60-second undo window after reset ("Undo clearing")
- Checkbox states persist across page reloads and visits

**Documentation & Planning:**
- Documented visualizer architecture in future-features-roadmap.md
- Defined build-time vs runtime visualizers
- Defined activation methods (frontmatter, folder config, auto-detect, global)
- Chose Approach A (build-time resolution) over Approach B (runtime resolution)
- Updated CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md and TODO.md
- Created Phase 2 implementation plan skeleton

**Other Changes:**
- Renamed site from "Buff Baby Bakery" to "Buff Baby Kitchen"
- Reduced checkbox spacing
- Updated search-index.json spec (added image field)
